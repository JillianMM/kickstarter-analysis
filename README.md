Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
To use Excel Kickstarter Data Set to analyze historical data and determine outcomes of; successful, failed, and canceled fundraising campaigns to assist in the successful planning of future campaigns to ensure they meet future fundraising goals. First, by analyzing theater events using filters, pivot tables, and charts for visualization. After that analyzing the subcategory of plays with formulas to summarize successful, failed, and canceled events.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
An analysis of the Outcomes Based on the Launch date showed that the most successful month for "theater" was May, followed by June and July. The least successful months were January, March, October, and December. With the highest number of cancelations in January and the most failures in October.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The analysis for outcomes based on Goals showed that plays with goals set from 1,000 or less and up to 10,000 tend to be successful. Plays with goals set from less than 1,000 to 4,999 had shown a success rate of 73% and higher. Plays with goals set higher than that are not as likely to succeed, with a 95% failure rate in the 15,000 to 20,000 range. There were some successful campaigns in the higher goal ranges, but more analysis is needed in this area since there number of campaigns significantly drops as the goal amounts increase.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The most difficult part of this exercise was discovering how to create months and using the =COUNTIFS formula. I overcame these obstacles by referring to my classmates and using youtube to find additional instruction. I did refer to the help, but a lot was left unexplained, especially for in the area of COUNTIFS. 
## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
* May is the best month to have a Theater fundrasing event. 
* January and December are the least successful months to hold Theater fundrasing events. 
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
* Events with goals set below $5000 tend to be the most successful. 
* The higher the goal, the less likely the event will succeed.  
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
* Other factors should be considered, such as location, type of theater event, whether it was a comedy or a musical or other, attendee demographics, canceled events close to holidays, and cost of production vs. revenue. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
* Successful, failed, canceled by location and month
* Successful, failed, canceled by location and goal
* Successful, failed, canceled by location and pledge amount
